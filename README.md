# Standards for the federated systems and interoperability in sensor networks

## Context

This document is a **draft** set of standards and recommendations for the observatories. The national Urban Observatory **MUST** adopt a degree of unanimity in the way it presents data, to allow either a single entrypoint API, or a capable client, to negotiate data from all the observatory locations, and thereby performing meaningful comparisons and analysis.
