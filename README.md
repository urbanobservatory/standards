# RCUK Urban Observatories
## Standards for federation and interoperability

### Context

This document is a **draft** set of standards and recommendations for the observatories. The national Urban Observatory **MUST** adopt a degree of unanimity in the way it presents data, to allow either a single entrypoint API, or a capable client, to negotiate data from all the observatory locations, and thereby performing meaningful comparisons and analysis.

### Specification

You can view the most recent draft [on this page](https://urbanobservatory.github.io/standards/).
You will find most of the detail that has yet to be incorporated into the document under discussion in [this list of outstanding issues](https://github.com/urbanobservatory/standards/issues).

### Namespace

All vocabulary terms and the ontology for collections, filtering and hypermedia are defined in the `uo` namespace. Additional guidance and requirements for adding terms to the pan-observatory vocabulary is provided [on this page](docs/latest/ns).

### Get involved...
