      <p>The urban observatories are a group of academic institutions across Great Britain deploying networks of sensors 
        to facilitate science, evidence-based decision making, and the smart cities of the future. Sensors, 
        communications networks and equipment installed by these institutions are used to provide open data, consumed 
        by members of the public and government. The presentation of data and context for these sensor networks is the
        scope of this document.</p>

      <div class="issue">
        <p>This entire document is a work in progress, and very little work has yet begun to implement the standards
          described herein. Detail discussed may be removed or superseded without warning; you are advised to follow 
          issues relevant to your work in <a href="https://github.com/urbanobservatory/standards/issues">this list</a> 
          until this document is stable.</p>
      </div>  
    </section>
    
    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Motivation and background</h2>

      <p>Networks of urban sensors are increasingly prevalent. There are many uses for these devices connected to the
        Internet of Things, such as sharing car park occupancy, pollution management, weather forecasting, public safety,
        and visitor statistics. These networks often form part of a service provision, such as receiving payment for
        parking services, enforcement of road user charging schemes, or the timely emptying of public bins. Elements of
        these applications are frequently referred to as smart city technologies, but many sensor networks have long
        histories, such as CCTV networks. Developing new services which consume and provide processed and derivative
        data, for example using real-time bus locations to forecast arrival times, would likely depend on a vendor- or
        domain-specific implementation, consuming data from APIs based on their documented methods and interfaces, and
        thereby constraining the code to a single data model.</p>
        
      <p>There is a need for a standard that focuses on extensibility, reuse of established standards, and is
        comparatively trivial to implement as a layer on top of existing software and services. The [[hydra-core]]
        vocabulary for example, provides an established means of pagingating response data and implementing URI
        templates, and can easily be combined with [[vocab-ssn-ext]]. The ontologies recommended in this document are
        selected because of their relevance to real-time sensor networks, but it should be possible to combine this
        approach with other standards such as PAS 180 and ISO/IEC 30182:2017 Smart City Vocabulary, descriptions of the
        built environment in [[IFC]], or [[CityGML]], or elements of JSON Schema and OpenAPI to enhance client-side
        validation. There are numerous domain-specific data models, such as the SIRI (CEN/TS 14431-1:2015) and 
        TransXChange used in public transport services; these vocabularies and ontologies can be used alongside this 
        standard, though the serialisation of data may vary, but translation between these formats (e.g. JSON-LD to 
        XML) can be automated and is relatively trivial.</p>

      <p>There are no widely accepted standards for interoperability in the Internet of Things, that would allow a
        service to operate using data from different sources, without changes in code. Recent efforts to develop
        appropriate standards, such as [[wot-architecture]] have addressed many issues, but are intended to describe
        the connected devices in their entirety, ranging from internet gateways through to communication (e.g. CoAP).
        There are similarities between the standard herein and [[ngsi-ld]], but we present an approach that uses
        a machine-readable documentation to describe possible interactions with properties and operations on types.
        Crucially, no prior knowledge of the API beyond a client with understanding of the hypermedia is required, which
        is used as the engine of application state (HATEOAS), to satisfy the requirements of [[REST]].</p>

      <p>This document presents a proposed standard for <strong>publishing federated networks of sensors and services,
        focusing on mechanisms for discovery, obtaining real-time and historic data, and contextual data</strong>. It
        does this primarily by clarifying the use of existing standards, resolving ambiguity and
        omissions from these, and incorporating detailed examples. These combined create a linked federation of [[REST]] 
        APIs, enabled by standardised hypermedia. Device and service discovery is facilitated through geographical
        relations, with links to other comformant systems created using permissions and trust relationships.</p>

      <section id="maturity" class="informative">
        <h3>Maturity</h3>

        <p>The maturity model comprises different levels that ultimately facilitate data integration across different
          domains, systems and data models. The aim of this standard is to achieve level six and move closer towards
          seven.</p>

        <ol start="0">
          <li>Data only available through propreitary interfaces</li>
          <li>Data available using a single data model and domain-specific interface, such as BACNET, KNX, SIRI-RT</li>
          <li>Data available using an HTTP(S) API with developer-focused documentation</li>
          <li>Data available using a publish-subcribe model or real-time stream</li>
          <li>Data available using an REST API with a recognised hypermedia and cross-domain standards</li>
          <li>Data accompanied by relevant context, such as links to geographic entities in other systems</li>
          <li>Data is discoverable by completely automated means based on geography, beacons, or similar</li>
          <li>Data is fully queryable by automated means, through convergence on authoritative vocabularies and their
            adoption</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Another model for services?</p>

      <section id="principles" class="informative">
        <h3>Principles</h3>

        <p>This standard has been prepared to satisfy the following general principles.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>It MUST be possible to discover sensors in different cities and disparate systems by following sequential
            links from a single national or international entrypoint.</li>
          <li>Data MUST be accompanied by links to <a href="https://5stardata.info/en/">relevant contextual
            information</a>, through a machine-readable hypermedia.</li>
          <li>Options for extensibility SHOULD be maintained and able to coexist within a single system, such as
            provision for controllers and actuation, data provenance, and the use of related ontologies.</li>
          <li>Implementation MAY take any form (i.e. any sensors, any database, any underlying communications protocols),
            provided the output and interface conforms to the standards herein.</li>
          <li>Entities including sensors SHOULD be partitioned across multiple APIs, provided links are registered so
            sensors can easily be found through geographies and types.</li>
          <li>This standard MUST be composed of existing standards, except where no viable standard exists, or two
            standards are incompatible. It SHOULD be possible to integrate data published with this standard with
            a wide range of ontologies.</li>
        </ol>

      <h2>Conformance</h2>

      <p>As well as sections marked as non-normative, all authoring guidelines, diagrams, examples, and notes in this 
        specification are non-normative. Everything else in this specification is normative.</p>
          
      <p>The key words MAY, MUST, MUST NOT, NOT RECOMMENDED, OPTIONAL, RECOMMENDED, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD, 
        and SHOULD NOT in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [[!RFC2119]] [[!RFC8174]] when, and
        only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</p>

      <p>Data SHOULD be provided under a licence compatible with the <a href="https://opendefinition.org/">Open
        Definition</a> unless there are overriding reasons, such as personal data or the IPR resides elsewhere</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="architecture">
      <h2>Architecture</h2>

      <p>A federated approach is adopted.</p>
        
      <p>The figure below shows the generalised architecture for a federated network of sensors and services conforming to 
        these standards. Implementation details such as the choice of database, sensor hardware, and communications 
        networks shown in blue are outside the scope of this document; implementations are free to choose these 
        details and use any appropriate technology or codebase.</p>

      <p>Each city or public-facing API therein MUST be serialised using the vocabularies described in
        <a href="#individual-systems" class="sectionRef"></a>, with all functionality prescribed.</p>
        
      <p>Integration services such as APIs serving geographies shared by more than one city, MUST in addition offer the 
        predicate registration functionality described in <a href="#federation" class="sectionRef"></a> and MUST implement
        <a href="#authentication"></a> to prevent misuse of this. This is OPTIONAL for systems that do not provide
        authority to register predicates from another system.</p>

      <div class="illustration">

            <img src="figures/federated-architecture.png"

             registration of sensors against shared geographies" />

          </figure>
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>It is RECOMMENDED to provide storage of data obtained from sensors in cases where brokerage cannot obtain
        historic observations directly from the device or device's own platform (e.g. where a sensor has its own cloud
        platform).</p>
      
      <p>Implementations MAY provide direct access to sensor data through a live transformation of data obtained from 
        the sensor or its platform, provided the eventual output is conformant. Implementations MAY provide a mixed 
        approach, where historic data is obtained from a different endpoint to live observations.</p>

        <h3>Filtering</h3>

        <p>The Hydra standard doesn't currently offer any filtering, so this section will probably need to be quite 
          substantial.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="streaming">
        <h3>Streaming</h3>

        <p>Access to live and potentially filtered data via WebSockets.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="receiver">
        <h3>Receiver</h3>

        <p>Ability to receive data directly submitted from an instrument or another system, as opposed to pulling 
          through brokerage systems. What shape should this data take, in order that links to appropriate resources
          could be generated automatically?</p>
      </section>

      <section id="authentication">
        <h3>Authentication</h3>

        <p>Ability to register a new relation between two IRIs will require authentication and creation of trust 
          relationships. Likely to rely on a callback approach, one system asks for permissions on the other system,
          and once these are granted a callback is invokved on the requesting system.</p>

      <section id="linked-data-fragments">
        <h3>Linked data fragments</h3>

        <p>This is a way of allowing complex queries such as SPARQL against the data, without having to run a full-blown
          SPARQL database and exposing it to the world. The problem with exposing SPARQL endpoints and hitting them
          with POST queries for example, is the response cannot be cached. It does not work well with HTTP. Linked
          data fragments don't have this problem.</p>

        <h3>Shared geographies</h3>

        <p>The proposal here is to have a national geography API and delegate authority to each city to be able to
          register sensors against.</p>

          <p>The national geography API contains resources corresponding to each local authority and city region. These

        <h3>Requests and responses for APIs</h3>

        <p>This section uses two examples to illustrate how data that abides by the ontology may look, both when it is 
          stored to a database, and when it is served to a client via the API. They are</p>
        
        <ol>
          <li>air temperature measurements made by static weather stations dotted around a city (in this case
            Birmingham), and</li>
          <li>thermal images of buildings taken from a van-mounted camera as it drives around the city (in this case 
            Sheffield).</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The section headings below are each names of 
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/#overview-of-classes-and-properties">[[vocab-ssn]] Ontology Classes</a>.
          These MAY form <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/databases-and-collections/#collections">
          collections</a> in a database. A collection is equivalent to a table in a relational database.</p>
        
        <section>
          <h4>Deployment</h4>
          
          <p>This term is defined in full as part of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/#SSNDeployment">[[vocab-ssn]]</a>.
            Each observatory will have a number of deployments across their respective cities investigating various
            different research areas and work packages. Each deployment MAY have its own document in a database
            collection called deployments.</p>
          
            <div class="issue">
              <p>Should this API request and response include details of authentication and additional headers that
                might be required?</p>
            </div>  
          
          <aside class="example" title="Request and response for a single deployment stored in a NoSQL database">
            <p>The deployment is a network of weather stations dotted across the city for 2 years. This deployment has
              been assigned an identifier, <em>birmingham-weather-stations</em>.</p>

            <p>Given the following database document:</p>

            <pre>
            {
              "id": "birmingham-weather-stations", 
              "name": "Birmingham Weather Stations",
              "description": "A network of static weather stations located on tripods, and street 
                furniture, across Birmingham for 2 years."
            }
            </pre>

            <aside class="note" title="Requirements for IDs used in JSON-LD responses">
              <p>The <code>@id</code> provided in the JSON-LD responses is an IRI, and as such must conform to the 
                character restrictions in [[RFC3987]]. These IRIs are therefore unique across all observatories, but each
                system is responsible for enforcing a unique constraint on paths under its domain.</p>

            <p>The following request should generate this conformant response:</p>
